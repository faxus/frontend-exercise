## Assignment: 
Create a clone of this repo and setup a webapp wich a multiple-select-filter. See details below. Our goal is to get an idea of how you setup a webapp and overcome technical challenges.

## Given assets:
* JSON file with data entries for the multi-select (470 items)
* Multi-select design
* Search-icon (svg)

## Requirements:
* Show the multi-select and fill it with the given JSON data
* Create a search which can filter the JSON data
* Make it possible to select multiple items
* Selected items need to be ordered on top, also they should not be affected by the search filter
* BONUS: store the selected items locally. They should persist after page reload.

## Primary criteria:
* structured HTML/CSS/Javascript
* JS architecture (ex. MVC pattern)
* HTTP/REST
* ES6 / TypeScript

## Secondary criteria:
* Advanced css (Less/Sass/Responsive/?)
* Data storage
* Build street setup (npm/gulp/webpack/?)

## Takeaways:
* You write well structured code (use common practices / coding patterns)
* It ok if you do not finish the project. Our goal is to get an insight of your skills. Though it helps if (part of) the code works ;)
* It's a plus if you write Vanilla JS (rather than using frameworks like Angular, React). Using Vanilla JS, you can prove that you know the inner workings of Javascript and are able to reproduce practices that are used in frameworks.
* It's a plus if you use Typescript of ES6
* It's a plus if you use TDD or BDD
